- Identify the roles of each of the objects.
- For each object, identify the roles of their lifecycle events.
- Rename variables whose meanings I don't understand outright.

## Old TODOs that I might come back to later
- Convert obj_dialogue_vStruct and creation script to structs-based approach.
  - On each page turn: set up portrait, voice, font, name, speaker, portrait_talk, portrait_talk_x, portrait_talk_y, portrait_idle, portrait_idle_x, portrait_idle_y, portrait_talk_n, portrait_talk_s
    - Fall back to defaults when none provided
- Test and fix until opening text works same as original.
- Convert par_speaker_vStruct to structs-based approach.
- Convert obj_examplechar_vStruct data to structs-based approach.
- Test and fix until new example char conversation works same as original.
- Refactor, clarify, and simplify event lifecycle code wherever simplifications can be found.
- Do likewise for the events themselves. Is each event's role clearly defined in the process?
- Review feature and identify how to add/remove dialogue features.
- For fun, add your own text effect
- Also for fun, add a dialog feature
- Replace original with new version.
