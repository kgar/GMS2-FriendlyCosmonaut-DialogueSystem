## To Do (formerly, Stretches)
- Establish cursor position management in cursor event handling.
  - Rename pointer coordinates to current___ and target___.
  - Detach cursor from selected index; manage cursor separately
  - Recreate original positioning functionality but driven by user input rather than simply highlighted index.
- Prepare for scroll behavior
  - Detect number of available visible lines
  - Using current cursor position and current line, handle the use cases
- Update the dialogue choice cursor handling so that when the cursor is attempting to move to an option beyond the bottom of the textbox, offset the choices rather than the cursor
- Make sure this scrolling effect works in both directions and when wrapping around
- Add a surface whose size matches the available textbox space for choices
  - If the surface already exists, resize it to the target dimensions
  - Ensure the existence check is made
- Draw the choices in the surface instead of in the regular application_surface, adjusting the coordinates accordingly
- Ensure the surface is freed on textbox destroy
- Update choice pointer to animate
  - Subtle bounce effect where the arrow accelerates to the right, bounces back very slowly, then repeats

## Refactoring
- Character spec generation has gotten messy and voluminous. Move it its own script file and make it easier to read.
- Am I deleting specs? Can we go ahead and delete specs when done with them?
  - Consider writing a recursive / reflective function to crawl through a struct graph and delete all structs...
- Create specMaxIndex variable for obj and use it.
- Create function for skipping to end of typewriting and extract all manual logic.
- Can I eliminate any more variables from the textbox object?
- Is there a less manual way to handle text ranges?
- Challenge: Refactor rainbow text to no longer depend on drawTextX in order to shift vertically correlated colors.
  - Hmm... divide the screen into 255 slices?
  - Somehow determine with the passage of time that hue should circularly shift to the left...
  - Somehow do this without holding any variables so that all rainbow text behaves as if some kind of masking were being used.
- Make text effects drawing reusable
- Convert as many hardcoded assets to strings and use asset_get_index() on them.
- Establish that textColor `undefined` means to use the default dialogue font. Update all dialogues to leverage this.

## Research and Needs Work
- How could I handle JSON-driven dialogue workflow while also allowing for running full GML scripts?
  - Some ideas:
    - use the function execution technique that FriendlyCosmonaut uses with the big switch
    - ...?
- Implement dialogue participants context
  - Have the ability to declare who all is in a conversation and at what point in the conversation they are present or absent
  - Imagine this kind of context allowing for visualizations like showing character busts all at once on the screen and emphasizing the current speaker.
- Change interpolation wording to be more template-focused
  - Look up JS templates on MDN and try to get a handle on an understandable series of variable names for the templating feature.

# Punted for standalone projects
- Implement a treasure chest object that leverages the dialogue engine and is extensible / persistable
  - Ideas:
    - Use a global map to associated rooms / some other identifier with a group of treasure chests
    - On room load / arrival / whatever, it should check to see what treasures to place
    - The treasure state will be held by the global treasure map
    - Upon creating the treasure object, it will then call the Init() function for the treasure, passing in its state
    - Research: Is there a way to manage treasure state per room via files rather than global memory? At what point would it be worth the trouble?
    - Treasure state:
      - Position in room
      - Items contained in chest
      - Chest opened or closed
      - Chest locked/unlocked state
      - Chest conditions for unlocking
      - Script references for special events
      - Special messaging or events associated with the chest
      - Chest type (e.g., wooden chest, mossy crate, iron chest, etc.) and that chest's attributes (sfx, opening animation sequence, etc.)
- Create character metadata structs in global scope
  - The struct contains name, all portrait data, etc.
  - Implement character's side preference and level of intensity
    - The hero's portrait is always on the left with intensity of 100
    - A villain's portrait is always on the right with intensity of 100
    - A character type that has no real preference will go on the side that the other character does not prefer. 
  - ... there are probably other things that could be added to this
  - Ooo, and then upgrade that character metadata to be read from a JSON file
  - Allow for a single character, e.g., a protag, to have their metadata changed as the game progresses, so all dialogues that reference the protag will have access to the latest sprites / other metadata.
- Add portrait semi-random 1-2 blinks during idle
  - Idle State = dialogue is finished type-writing
  - Idle portrait Should work with or without blink frames
